# Steps to SET PATH and Import Custom Written Module

I has used PYTHONPATH to set the path to my package "GEHU"



1. Go to envrionment variable


2. Under ‘User variables’ click ‘New’. Variable name is equal to ‘PYTHONPATH’


3. Set Path where you kept your module or package. In my case i have kept it in this path

"D:\Study\Github Repos\MCA3_lab_practicals\MCA3HLD\20711136 -  Himanshu Chandola\Codes\Import_Modules_Demonstration"

So i will give this path under Variable value in Step 3


4. Thats it. Import your package in your program
